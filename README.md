# üêÆ longhorn-scheduler

This is a fork of [linstor-scheduler-extender] modified to work with [Longhorn]
volumes. It uses [Stork] to schedule pods alongside existing replicas for
optimal performance.

This is in contrast to Longhorn's built-in [data locality] functionality, which
only affect pods that have already been scheduled, and which re-allocates
replicas to achieve locality.

## Deployment

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/longhorn-scheduler.yaml
```

## Usage

Use `schedulerName: longhorn` in your pod spec to take advantage of the
scheduler.

## Admission controller

You can also deploy the admission controller to automatically assign
`schedulerName: longhorn` to all pods with Longhorn volumes:

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/longhorn-scheduler-admission.yaml
```
